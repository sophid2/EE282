# EE282 Homework #2 Assignment

## Generating 3 Homework Questions Based on the Three Prompts

---

## Question #1

### Prompt
Ask a problem that requires a student to understand basic manipulation of files.  
Your question should require an answer using the following commands/concepts:  
`ls`, `touch`, `mv`, `rm`

---

### Question

You are a graduate student working on a project in your lab to study different opsin types in *Speyeria mormonia* butterfly eyes. Your lab keeps all project files in a shared `project/` directory on a server, and your PI has asked you to organize the files for the project.

Using Bash, how would you do the following?

1. List all of the contents of the `project/` directory to see what files are there.
2. Create three empty files named `Speyeriadata1.txt`, `Speyeriadata2.txt`, and `notes.txt`.
3. Rename `notes.txt` to `README.txt`.
4. Organize all of the data into a subdirectory by creating a new directory called `raw_data/` and then move `Speyeriadata1.txt` and `Speyeriadata2.txt` into it.
5. You then find that there is an issue with the `Speyeriadata2.txt` file and want to delete it. How do you delete it from inside the `raw_data/` directory?
6. How would you check your work to confirm that you organized all the *Speyeria* project files correctly?  
   *(Hint: list the contents of both `project/` and `raw_data/`)*

## Question #2

### Prompt
Ask a question that requires a student to understand the difference between accessing a column in a matrix with numeric indices versus accessing a column in a data frame with numeric indices.

Your question should require an answer comparing:
- `mymatrix[, 1]`
- `mydf[, 1]`
- `mydf[1]`
- `mydf[[1]]`

---

### Question 

Imagine that you are working in a lab conducting immunohistochemistry experiments on *Speyeria mormonia* butterfly eyes to study opsin expression. Your PI provides you with two versions of a dataset from one of your experiments:

- One dataset stored as a **matrix**
- One dataset stored as a **data frame**

To examine the data, you load both versions into R:

```r
mymatrix <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2)
colnames(mymatrix) <- c("Opsin Types", "Visual Patterns")

Speyeriadf <- data.frame(
  Opsin_Types = c(1, 2),
  Visual_Patterns = c("blue", "uv")
)
```
Using the data above, predict the output for each expression and answer the following questions:

```r
mymatrix[, 1]
Speyeriadf[, 1]
Speyeriadf[1]
Speyeriadf[[1]]
```
1. Write the expected output for each expression.
2. Is each output a numeric vector or a dataframe?
3. Indicate whether the column names and dimensions were preserved for each output.

## Question #3

### Prompt
Ask a question that requires a student to understand how to create a simple script and make it usable by everyone, but only writable by its creator.

Your question should require an answer using `chmod NNN` (octal permissions).

---

### Questions

You have been working on code for your *Speyeria mormonia* butterfly project and recently wrote a short R script that prints a final summary message after finishing an analysis. Your labmates are interested in using your script. Your lab uses a shared Linux server.

You are happy to share the script, but you want to ensure that **only you can edit it**, while **everyone can execute it**.

To start, you create a file called `summary.Speyeria` with the following contents:

```r
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
print("Speyeria mormonia summary complete")
```
When checking the file permissions, you realize that the script is not executable.

How would you share your script with your labmates so that the script is executable by everyone but only you can edit it, avoiding any potential or accidental changes?

1. What command would you use to change the permissions of summary.Speyeria so that:
- You (the owner) can read, write, and execute the script.
- Other lab members can read and execute the script, but not modify it.
- Other users on the system can read and execute the script, but not modify it.

(Hint: Your answer must use numeric (octal) permissions in the form: 
`chmod NNN summary.Speyeria`)

2. Explain what each individual digit of your octal permission setting represents.
3. How can you verify that the permissions were assigned correctly?

# ANSWER KEY 

## Question #1
1. List contents of the project directory 
`ls`

2. Create three empty files 
`touch` `Speyeriadata1.txt` `Speyeriadata2.txt` `notes.txt`

3. Rename notes.txt to README.txt 
`mv` `notes.txt` `README.txt` 

4. Create raw_data directory and move data files 
`mkdir raw_data` 
`mv Speyeriadata1.txt Speyeriadata2.txt raw_data/` 

5. Delete `Speyeriadata2.txt` from `raw_data` 
`rm raw_data/data2.txt` 

6. List contents to verify changes 
`ls` 
`ls raw_data` 


## Question #2

1. `mymatrix[,1]` 
Output: 
`[1] 1 2` 

Type/Class: 
Numeric vector 

No preserved column names 
No dimensions preserved 

Explanation: 
Matrices are atomic structures. Extracting a single column drops dimensions by default, returning a vector.  


2. `Speyeriadf[,1]` 

Output: 
`[1] 1 2` 

Type/Class: 
Numeric vector

No column names preserved. 
No dimensions preserved. 

Explanation: 
`Using [, 1] on a data frame behaves like a matrix-style indexing. R simplifies the result and drops the data frame structure.` 

3. `Speyeriadf[1]`
Output: 
`Opsin Types 
1 1 
2 2` 

Type/Class: 
Data frame 

Column names are preserved. 
Dimensions are preserved. 

Explanation: 
Single brackets [ return a subset of the data frame, not the contents of the column. 


4. `Speyeriadf[[1]]` 

Output: 
`[1] 1 2` 

Type/Class: 
Numeric vector 

Column names are not preserved. 
Dimensions are not preserved. 

Explanation:
Double brackets [[ means the contents of a single column, which removes all of the data frame structure. 


## Question #3

1. in Bash: 

The correct chmod Command is: 
        `chmod 755 summary.Speyeria`


The three digits 755 correspond to owner, group, and others, in that order. Each digit is the sum of the permission values.


2. This is what each individual digit means

   The first digit 7 —> permissions for the owner:
   7= 4 (read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute)
   You as the owner can read, write/ change, and execute your script.  


   Second digit 5 —> permissions for the group: 
   5 = 4 (read) + 1 (execute) 
   The group can view your script and run it, but not be able to change it. 

   Third digit 5 —> permissions for others:
   5 = 4 (read) + 1 (execute) 
   Anyone can view it and run your script but not be able to change it. 


3. To double check your work you can use the `ls` command:

`ls -1 summary.speyeria`

If all the permissions are assigned correctly then you should get this output:
`-rwxr-xr-x summary.Speyeria`


        Owner (rwx): read, write, execute
        Group (r-x): read, execute
        Others (r-x): read, execute
