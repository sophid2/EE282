# Characterizing Opsin Protein Spatial Expression and Ommatidia Morphology in _Speyeria mormonia_ Butterflies: Insights into Function and Visual Ecology

**By:** Sofia Diaz

## Introduction: 
The evolution of visual systems is central to evolutionary biology due to its contribution to species diversification. Investigations into color vision and visual systems have been instrumental in understanding how organisms perceive their environments and interact with one another (Gerl and Morris 2008). Unique visual genes, such as opsins, are responsible for detecting specific wavelengths of light and have been observed in various organisms (Terakita 2005). Located in retinal photoreceptor cells, opsins enable light detection, triggering phototransduction, which allows organisms to interpret visual cues (Briscoe 2001). Studies have shown that gene duplications have led to the diversity of opsins, resulting in variation in photoreceptor types and visual abilities, and consequently, differences in behaviors in response to diversified opsin patterning across species (Briscoe 2001; Frentiu et al. 2007; Feuda et al. 2016). Additionally, exploring the structure and morphology of the eye, such as ommatidia structure, provides a link to eye morphology and functionality. In butterflies, color vision is critical for behaviors like foraging, mate selection, and ovipositing (Arikawa 2017). The compound eye of a butterfly is composed of many structural units called ommatidia; each individual ommatidium contains a cluster of nine photoreceptor cells, exhibiting opsin configurations that lead to species-specific visual abilities (Briscoe and Chittka 2001). Nymphalid butterflies are a diverse family of brush-footed butterflies that have been known to possess limited photoreceptor diversity with typically three to four spectral types of photoreceptors (McCulloch et al. 2016). The spatial expression of opsin proteins has been documented in some nymphalid butterfly species, highlighting opsin patterning of the R1 through R8 photoreceptor cells (McCulloch et al. 2016). To further understand the extent of photoreceptor diversity, color vision, and its link to function in Nymphalidae, additional nymphalid butterflies must be studied. In this project, I examined _Speyeria mormonia_, a nymphalid butterfly species from Colorado. _Speyeria mormonia_ opsin expression has yet to be characterized at the protein level, and ommatidia morphology has yet to be documented. This study aims to characterize opsin protein expression and ommatidial morphology in male _Speyeria mormonia_ butterfly eyes to explore opsin configurations and ommatidial structure in relation to their functions and visual ecology in their natural environment. 

The proposed project is well suited for our bioinformatics course, as tools such as RStudio will be used to explore _Speyeria mormonia_ opsin expression and ommatidia morphology. By quantifying these datasets, bioinformatics can statistically test opsin pattern types and ommatidial structure types to identify potential differences and similarities within the male _Speyeria mormonia_ eyes. These analyses will reveal what patterns are present, in what quantities, and whether these patterns and morphologies are statistically significant, demonstrating their functional and behavioral relevance. Bioinformatics will therefore enhance the visualization and characterization of opsin spatial expression and ommatidia morphology, deepening our understanding of color vision in the _Speyeria mormonia_ system. 

## Questions 
The goal of this project is to gain a stronger understanding of the color vision capabilities of _Speyeria mormonia_ butterflies by characterizing opsin protein-level expression and ommatidia cellular structure and morphology. The first question I aim to address in this study is: **What is the proportion and distribution of opsin types throughout _Speyeria mormonia_ eyes?** Second; **Does the morphology of ommatidia vary across different regions of the eye in _Speyeria mormonia_ butterflies, and what are the proportions and spatial distributions of each ommatidia type throughout the eye?**

## Data 
During the summer, I conducted immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments on male _Speyeria mormonia_ butterflies. I generated a large dataset of confocal images, examining the staining of the R1 and R2 photoreceptor cells to determine what opsin protein expression looked like in this system. The focal data I intend to use for this proposal will be ommatidia counts using these IHC images. Manual ommatidia counts will be conducted for the ommatidia opsin patterns of the R1 and R2 photoreceptor cells. Ommatidia subtypes will be counted for six of the best-quality images, in which the tissue was not folded, and cell bodies are clearly labeled without high levels of background. For morphology, six of the best-quality longitudinal section IHC images will be used and individual ommatidium will be marked based on morphololgical structure. Images will be viewed at full resolution in Adobe Illustrator or ZEISS ZEN Lite (a microscopy software), and ommatidia will be individually marked according to their R1/R2 cell staining. The goal will be to focus on the twelve best IHC confocal images to establish a workable dataset to explore these questions within the scope of the class.

## Analysis Plan 
This proposal is an attempt to examine the opsin spatial expression and ommatidia morphologies of _Speyeria mormonia_ males. I plan to conduct exploratory data analysis on the abundance and distribution of photoreceptor and ommatidia types using frequency calculations, statistical testing, and plotting in RStudio to test for ommatidia and photoreceptor distribution differences between the opsin patterns and ommatidia morphology types of male _Speyeria mormonia_ butterflies. I aim to create plots to visualize the percentages of photoreceptor types based on UV and blue expression and ommatidia morphology in male _Speyeria mormonia_ eyes. In addition to plotting and statistical testing, I plan to use RStudio to generate figures of my IHC images to visualize the photoreceptor types based on UV and blue expression, as well as different ommatidia morphologies found throughout the eye.

## Feasibility
This proposed analysis is feasible given that I will be working with my own dataset of _Speyeria mormonia_ IHC images. For this class, I will manually count ommatidia opsin patterns and ommatidia morphologies from the twelve best-quality images, ensuring I collect enough data for statistical analysis within the timeframe of this course. This approach allows me to efficiently address my research questions using a manageable and sufficient dataset.

## Conclusion
By examining opsin protein expression and eye morphology, we can identify how species perceive color and their range of color vision. These insights will aid in understanding visual systems and their adaptations to various environments. The spatial expression of opsin proteins in _Speyeria mormonia_ butterflies remains an unexplored frontier, representing a critical gap in our understanding of their visual system. By analyzing ommatidia structural types and opsin patterns, this research not only sheds light on the intricate mechanisms underpinning color vision in _Speyeria mormonia_ but also highlights how unique cellular morphologies and protein expression drive distinct behavioral and ecological outcomes. This project aims to connect opsin expression and morphology with color vision, behavior, and ecological function in this butterfly species to gain a further understanding of the extent of color vision within the family Nymphalidae. And utilizing bioinformatics will effectively communicate the opsin spatial expression and ommatidia data, showcasing valuable insights that could transform our broader understanding of butterfly visual ecology and evolutionary biology.
